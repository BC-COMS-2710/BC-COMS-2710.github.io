# Computational Text Analysis Course

## Short summary (Catalog Description)

This undergraduate course will introduce students to the methods and tools used in computational text analysis, aka <i>text as data</i>.
This course focuses on methods used to <i>discover</i> and <i>measure</i> concepts and phenomena from large amounts of text. Students will implement methods covered in class and apply these methods to texts of their choosing.
No prior programming or math background is required, all necessary skills will be covered in the beginning of the course.

## Longer description (Course Overview)

This course covers foundational concepts in computational text analysis. 
The course is designed for humanities or social science students with little or no programming experience
who are interested in using text analysis methods to discover and measure concepts and phenomena in large amounts of text. 
Topics range from foundational programming concepts with a hands on introduction to Python, core computational text analysis concepts, basic statistical methods, and data visualization.
The course will culminate around research projects where groups of students will formulate and iteratively refine an empirical question; collect relevant textual data; implement appropriate methods of analysis; and interpret and present their results.


## Course Components:
The course contains the following components:

- Lectures covering programming fundamentals and computational text analysis topics.
- In-Class pair-programming activities implementing the methods discussed in lecture.
- One group project using text analysis tools to empirically investigate a research question.
- Weekly individual assignments for students to master the material and concepts
- One midterm exam testing students' mastery of the material.


## Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, students will have introductory software skills in Python and be able to:

- Implement core computational text analysis methods in Python
- Leverage advanced computational text analysis toolkits to *discover*, *measure*, and *explain* latent concepts, trends, phenomena in text 
- Develop and iteratively refine a research question and use text as data to empirically interpret their results 


##Course Materials
