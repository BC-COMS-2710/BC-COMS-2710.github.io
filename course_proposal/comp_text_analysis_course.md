# Computational Text Analysis Course

## Short summary (Catalog Description)

This research based undergraduate course will introduce students to the methods and tools used in computational text analysis, aka <i>text as data</i>.
This course focuses on methods used to <i>discover</i> and <i>measure</i> concepts and phenomena from large amounts of text. Students will implement methods covered in class and apply these methods to texts of their choosing.
Some prior programming experience is expected, though all necessary skills, including an overview of Unix and Python, will be covered in the beginning of the course.

**Modes of Thinking Requirement:** Thinking Quantitatively & Empirically, Thinking Technologically & Digitally

**Credit: 3**

**Enrollment Cap: 15 students**

## Longer description (Course Overview)

This course covers foundational concepts in computational text analysis. 
The course is designed for humanities or social science students with minimal prior programming experience or computer science students
who are interested in using text analysis methods to discover and measure concepts and phenomena in large amounts of text. 
Topics range from foundational programming concepts with a hands on introduction to Python, core computational text analysis concepts, basic statistical methods, and data visualization.
The course will culminate around research projects where groups of students will formulate and iteratively refine an empirical question; collect relevant textual data; implement appropriate methods of analysis; and interpret and present their results.

## Prerequisites
A prior programming course (e.g. [BC1016](http://coms1016.barnard.edu/), BC3050, W1004, E1006, W1002) and instructor approval required.



## Course Components:
The course contains the following components:

- Lectures covering programming fundamentals and computational text analysis topics.
- In-Class pair-programming activities implementing the methods discussed in lecture.
- One group semester-long project using text analysis tools to empirically investigate a research question.
- Weekly individual assignments for students to master the material and concepts
- Weekly readings and written summaries of computational text analysis studies
- One midterm exam testing students' mastery of the material.


## Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, students will have introductory software skills in Python and be able to:

- Implement core computational text analysis methods in Python
- Leverage advanced computational text analysis toolkits to *discover*, *measure*, and *explain* latent concepts, trends, phenomena in text 
- Collect textual data from online sources, e.g. social media data, newswire, Wikipedia, etc.
- Develop and iteratively refine a research question and use text as data to empirically interpret their results

## Barnard Student Honor Code
Approved by the student body in 1912 and updated in 2016, the Code states:

> We, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor of the College by engaging with integrity in all of our academic pursuits. We affirm that academic integrity is the honorable creation and presentation of our own work. We acknowledge that it is our responsibility to seek clarification of proper forms of collaboration and use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We consider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for all print, electronic, or other academic resources. We will respect the rights of others to engage in pursuit of learning in order to uphold our commitment to honor. We pledge to do all that is in our power to create a spirit of honesty and honor for its own sake.

## Wellness Statement
It is important for undergraduates to recognize and identify the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. We as a community urge you to make yourself--your own health, sanity, and wellness--your priority throughout this term and your career here. Sleep, exercise, and eating well can all be a part of a healthy regimen to cope with stress. Resources exist to support you in several sectors of your life, and we encourage you to make use of them. Should you have any questions about navigating these resources, please visit these sites:

## Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services Statement
If you believe you may encounter barriers to the academic environment due to a documented disability or emerging health challenges, please feel free to contact me and/or the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS). Any student with approved academic accommodations is encouraged to contact me during office hours or via email. If you have questions regarding registering a disability or receiving accommodations for the semester, please contact CARDS at (212) 854-4634, cards@barnard.edu, or learn more at barnard.edu/disabilityservices. CARDS is located in 101 Altschul Hall.

## Affordable Access to Course Texts and Materials Statement
All students deserve to be able to study and make use of course texts and materials regardless of cost. Barnard librarians have partnered with students, faculty, and staff to find ways to increase student access to textbooks. By the first day of advance registration for each term, faculty will have provided information about required texts for each course on CourseWorks (including ISBN or author, title, publisher, copyright date, and price), which can be viewed by students. A number of cost-free or low-cost methods for accessing some types of courses texts are detailed on the [Barnard Library Textbook Affordability guide](library.barnard.edu/textbook-affordability). Undergraduate students who identify as first-generation and/or low-income students may check out items from the FLIP lending libraries in the [Barnard Library](library.barnard.edu/flip) and in Butler Library for an entire semester. Students may also consult with their professors, the Dean of Studies, and the Financial Aid Office about additional affordable alternatives for having access to course texts. Visit the guide and talk to your professors and your librarian for more details.
