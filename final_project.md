# Final Project

The final project is an opportunity for you to ask a research question and use the methods covered in this class
to collect and analyze data to begin answering your research question.
The final project is a great way to demonstrate to yourself the skills you have mastered during this class. 
The final project can be done in a group of 2 students (or more with instructor's approval).

**Senior Theses and Existing Research Projects:**
If you are completing a senior thesis, you are encouraged to incorporate this course project as part of your senior thesis.

We discussed that the project is mainly about utilizing the methods we learned in class. There are 3 main things we need. The first is a good research question. The second is collecting the data and the third is drawing conclusions from the data using different methods from class. 

**Note:** The grade on the final project is not dependent on the findings. If the findings are inconclusive or do not answer your research question, that is ok. Although many of the papers we have read present their research as a linear story, in practice, research is rarely as smooth as seems in the paper. For the scope of the final project, the goal is to 1) ask a research question, 2) collect, filter, and clean a corpus, 3) use the methods covered in the class to try answering the research question by analyzing the collected corpus.

## Final Project Components

There are four main components of your research project:

#### Research Question

<!--Quantifiable in text.-->

#### Data Collection



#### Data Exploration



#### Prediction


## Deliverables

#### [Project ideation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yzpgxcgsqdvp) (5 points) - due Friday May 28th
This document will begin conversations between your group and the instructor about your final projects. 
The project ideation is a 250 word proposal that will provide an overview of what you are interested in. 

Please follow the instructions in this [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yzpgxcgsqdvp). Please copy the overleaf project and submit the a completed pdf on Gradescope. 

#### [Project Proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrqkdzbxhkym) (9 points) - due June 6th

The project proposal is a more formal version of the Project Ideation and should incorporate the feedback you received from your project ideation. 
You can view this as a road map that specifies how you plan to 

1. create a corpus to study by collecting, filtering and cleaning data
2. apply computational text analysis methods
3. Analyze your results. 

Please follow the instructions in this [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrqkdzbxhkym). Please copy the overleaf project and submit the a completed pdf on Gradescope.
