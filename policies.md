# Policies

### Disclaimer
These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgment of the course staff.

All times listed on the course webpage are in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

### Support
You are not alone in this course; the course staff
are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. Please use Piazza to ask questions. It is very likely that many of you will have the same questions so please post questions publicly on Piazza by default. This will allow your peers to answer your questions as well. We will also hold virtual office hours for real-time discussions. 

The Barnard CS help room is a great resources as well. At this point it is not clear if they will hold hours during the summer. Ideally they will but ultimately that is out of my hands. If they do, we will post the Zoom link on Piazza.

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite for BC COMS 2710 is some prior programming experience. We've listed classes at Barnard and Columbia that can fulfill this requirement. If you have programming experience and have not taken those previous classes, you are still welcome to enroll in BC COMS 2710. It is okay if you have experience in a programming language that is not Python, we will go over Python basics in the beginning of the course.

### Materials
We will be using a collection of textbooks, papers, and online resources. 
The three primary textbooks for this course are:
1. [Text Analysis in Python for Social Scientists](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/text-analysis-in-python-for-social-scientists/BFAB0A3604C7E29F6198EA2F7941DFF3). A copy has been put on course reserves at the Barnard Library. 
1. Jurafsky and Martin, Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft) [(online copy)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
2. [Computational Text Analysis Textbook](https://bc-coms-2710.github.io/textbook/welcome.html) is an online textbook. It is a modified version of the textbook Melanie Walsh at Cornell developed for her [Intro to Culturual Analytics course](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html).

Students are free to use their own computers, but you are encouraged to use [CUNIX (Columbia's Unix Platform)](https://cuit.columbia.edu/unix). We will go over how to use cunix during the first week of classes.
Data for all assignments will be hosted and accessible on cunix and all starter-code will be accessible via GitHub Classroom.

### Zoom Etiquitte
- Mute your microphone when you're not speaking
- Encouraged but not required:
  - Set your profile image to be a picture (or bitmoji) of you - it really helps make it feel like we're not talking to an empty room!
  - If possible, keep your camera on during class sessions

### Homework and Projects
Homework assignments are a required part of the course. They will be released on Mondays and Thursdays, and due on Thursdays and Sundays. Each student must submit each homework independently, but you are encouraged to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the "Learning Cooperatively" section below.

Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so a series of projects involving real data are a required part of the course. On each project, you may work with a single partner. Both partners will receive the same score.

#### Late days
To account for issues that arise in these uncertain times, each student has **XXX late** days for the homeworks and projects. However, you can only use at most **XXX late** days per assignment. 

### Barnard Student Honor Code
Approved by the student body in 1912 and updated in 2016, the Code states:

> We, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor of the College by engaging with integrity in all of our academic pursuits. We affirm that academic integrity is the honorable creation and presentation of our own work. We acknowledge that it is our responsibility to seek clarification of proper forms of collaboration and use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We consider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for all print, electronic, or other academic resources. We will respect the rights of others to engage in pursuit of learning in order to uphold our commitment to honor. We pledge to do all that is in our power to create a spirit of honesty and honor for its own sake.

More information about the honor code can be found at [https://barnard.edu/honor-code](https://barnard.edu/honor-code)

### Wellness Statement
It is important for undergraduates to recognize and identify the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. We as a community urge you to make yourself--your own health, sanity, and wellness--your priority throughout this term and your career here. Sleep, exercise, and eating well can all be a part of a healthy regimen to cope with stress. Resources exist to support you in several sectors of your life, and we encourage you to make use of them. Should you have any questions about navigating these resources, please visit these sites:

- [http://barnard.edu/counseling](http://barnard.edu/counseling)

- [Stressbusters Support Network](http://health.columbia.edu/files/healthservices/pdf/alice_Stressbusters_Support_Network.pdf)

### Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services Statement
If you believe you may encounter barriers to the academic environment due to a documented disability or emerging health challenges, please feel free to contact me and/or the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS). Any student with approved academic accommodations is encouraged to contact me during office hours or via email. If you have questions regarding registering a disability or receiving accommodations for the semester, please contact CARDS at (212) 854-4634, cards@barnard.edu, or learn more at barnard.edu/disabilityservices. CARDS is located in 101 Altschul Hall.

### Affordable Access to Course Texts and Materials Statement
All students deserve to be able to study and make use of course texts and materials regardless of cost. Barnard librarians have partnered with students, faculty, and staff to find ways to increase student access to textbooks. By the first day of advance registration for each term, faculty will have provided information about required texts for each course on CourseWorks (including ISBN or author, title, publisher, copyright date, and price), which can be viewed by students. A number of cost-free or low-cost methods for accessing some types of courses texts are detailed on the [Barnard Library Textbook Affordability guide](library.barnard.edu/textbook-affordability). Undergraduate students who identify as first-generation and/or low-income students may check out items from the FLIP lending libraries in the [Barnard Library](library.barnard.edu/flip) and in Butler Library for an entire semester. Students may also consult with their professors, the Dean of Studies, and the Financial Aid Office about additional affordable alternatives for having access to course texts. Visit the guide and talk to your professors and your librarian for more details.
